# This data is taken from my college society **eCell MSIT**, therefore csv file can't be on github for privacy reasons.

The main objective to take this data is to see which year students are more keen to be a part of the society, moreover which branch students show more presence in the events organised by society.

I know the data is too less to bring too much insights, but this is what I could get as of now. 

Perks of **Doing analysis of real-life data**:

1. It makes you help understand how actually a real problem can be solved using data.
2. It does encourage you to think of more real-life scenarios where data analysis can be done.
3. It obvioulsy tells how important is to do documentation.
